(These are notes to myself. They may not make sense to you. Better, more formal docs are coming :-).

Player:

just graphics for now...

Add the record.
Add the buttons (make them pressable/toggle for now...)
Add labels for artist, album, and title.... (hard code).
Add tone arm - also doesn't move. (angular dragging? not yet.)


Vault:

cosmetics and behaviors need refinement. For example, when we start the scroll,
we may want to fade out the albums and show them again when we stop...
but that's cosmetic.

Q: Should we always scroll back to the top song when switching between albums, or 
should the app remember where the user was last scrolled to for each album?


Queue:

just show songs added (for now - no frills) - queue is always paused (for now).

==

ISSUE: The collated view is hard coded. We should use Apple's implementation...

===
We should listen to the music library object in case the user updates their library
while the app is runnning...
