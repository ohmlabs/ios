FIXED OHM-15. The mutable playlist was incorrectly exchanging the index of the source and designation objects instead of actually moving the source object to its destination.
FIXED OHM-22. [Can't switch to] Gallery artists with "The" in the title. Now, if the artist name cannot initially be located, the code strips off the first word and tries again to locate the artist.
FIXED OHM-4. The playlists (and gallery) albums now pages 3 at a time...
FIXED OHM-8. Slow Artist Scroll [is an issue]. Artists cells now smoothly scroll and snap back at integral boundaries when coming to a stop.

Release Notes:

Build 1.0.1. 25 FEB 2012

Functional:

- Added an action button and action sheet on the Playlists screen (mostly not implemented).
- Bumped the build/bundle version so iTunes [might] overwrite the existing binary instead of requiring it to be deleted.
- Added new playlists to the left most position of the playlists scroll view so that the user sees the newest playlists first.
- Enabled editing of mutable playlists. Note: mutable and immutable playlists have different action sheets.

Cosmetic:

- Playlist cells now have transparencies.
- Aesthetic improvements to the playlists scroll view.
- Changed the playlist numbering in the simulator to start from 1 instead of 0.
- Changed the tint color of navigation bar buttons to better fit in with the new black background motif.
- Changed tableview text fonts and colors to be closer to recent screenshots.
- Moved the action button on the queue screen to the right.
- I'm calling mutable playlists "Ohm playlists" and immutable playlists synched from iTunes "iPod playlists" in the user interface's alert sheets.

Known Issues:

- Playlists don't have default colors yet. Instead they're using a default image.
- Only the Edit action item on the Playlist screen is currently implemented. The others are still just placeholders. Coming soon...
- If the user is editing a playlist and then selects another playlist, editing stops abruptly without animation. A better solution is for the playlists to scroll off the screen while editing...
- You can swipe to the right over an iPod playlist song and get a delete button to appear. Nothing will happen if you click delete, but the button should not appear in the first place.

Other Issues:

- I have no idea [yet] what will happen if you edit a playlist while it's playing :-)


//------------------------------------------------

Release Notes:

Build 1.0.2. 29 FEB 2012.

Functional:

- A swipe-to-right gesture on an immutable playlist song no longer erroneously shows a delete control.
- Allows creating an Ohm playlist from an iPod playlist.
- Added delete playlist method to OhmPlaylist Manager.
- Fixed a bug. The app now allows a playlist that hasn't been saved yet to be deleted anyway.
- Enabled deleting a playlist.
- Enabled renaming a playlist.
- Enabled copying mutable playlists (not just iPod playlists).
- Pevents a playlist on the playlist screen from being deleted by swiping.

New Known Issues:

- Deleting a playlist is NOT confirmed. It's deleted immediately. The user should be asked to confirm.

Outstanding Known Issues:

- Playlists don't have default colors yet. Instead they're using a default image.
- Add Photo is not implemented.
- If the user is editing a playlist and then selects another playlist, editing stops abruptly without animation. A better solution is for the playlists to scroll off the screen while editing...

Note: the following tester's devices were added to the Ad Hoc distro.

- Luke, Yasmine, Byron, Terry, George and Quincy.

//------------------------------------------------

Release Notes:

Build 1.0.3. 16 Mar 2012.

Functional:

- Fixed OHM-24. Album Artist and music lists screen.
- Fixed OHM-28. Playlist scroll speed. The playlists now scroll freely instead of paging on the playlists screen.
- Fixed OHM-29. Now playing/Gallery disjunct.
- Fixed OHM-31. Action Button (playlists)
- Fixed OHM-42. Playlist screen status.
- Fixed OHM-43. Call status bar disrupts.
- Added "Add to Queue" on playlist action sheet.
- Won't fix OHM-44. Behaves as implemented by Apple.

New Issues:

- A cosmetic issue on gallery screen remains when call status is displayed. A new approach to image assets will be needed...

Outstanding Known Issues:

- Deleting a playlist is NOT confirmed. It's deleted immediately. The user should be asked to confirm.
- Playlists don't have default colors yet. They're using a default image.
- Add Photo buttons do not work yet.
- If the user is editing a playlist and then selects another playlist, editing stops abruptly without animation. A better solution is for the playlists to scroll off the screen while editing...


//------------------------------------------------

Release Notes:

Build 1.0.4. 17 Mar 2012

Functional:

- Paritally implemented OHM-17. App Transitions.

New Issues:

- Launch the app. Transition to the LISTS screen. Try to transition back.
After playing with this, my instincts tell me that this isn't going to be acceptable to end users or Apple's App Store reveiwers.
I'm releasing this build, with just this one change, so everyone can evaluate the situation for themselves and give feedback. FYI.

Outstanding Known Issues:

- Deleting a playlist is NOT confirmed. It's deleted immediately. The user should be asked to confirm.
- Playlists don't have default colors yet. They're using a default image.
- Add Photo buttons do not work yet.
- If the user is editing a playlist and then selects another playlist, editing stops abruptly without animation. A better solution is for the playlists to scroll off the screen while editing...

//------------------------------------------------

Release Notes:

Build 1.0.5. 30 Mar 2012.

Functional:

- Fixed OHM-2. Shuffle buttons are now on the Music Gallery and Lists screens.
- Fixed OHM-3. Songs Lists character index (on the Music Lists Songs tab).
- Fixed OHM-43. Call Status disruption has been addressed, except for the specific case of the music gallery screen. That screen is addressed in a separate issue...
- Fixed OHM-53. Multiple NP Indicators in Playlist Screen. The problem was: when adding the back right arrow in the last build, I failed to update all of the segues. Now, when the user taps a song on the playlists screen, the song starts playing immediately and the player segues to the Now Playing / Ohm screen. This is the same functionality as the Queue, and as previously designed.
- On the Music Lists screens Songs tab, you can horizontally swipe in either direction to add a song to the queue (there's little feedback).
- On the same screen, if you press and hold an action sheet appears allowing users to add a song to the queue.

New Issues:

- The slide to add to queue gesture and long press gesture only work on the Music Lists - Song tab, for now.

Outstanding Known Issues:

- BUG: Found at the last minute - the shuffle button doesn't put the iPod into shuffle mode (so music isn't shuffled).
- Playlists don't have default colors yet. They're using a default image.
- Add Photo buttons do not work yet.
- Add To Playlist is not represented at all.
- If the user is editing a playlist and then selects another playlist, editing stops abruptly without animation. A better solution is for the playlists to scroll off the screen while editing...

//------------------------------------------------

Release Notes:

Build 1.0.6.1 Apr 6, 2012

Functional:

- Fixed. The shuffle button now puts the iPod into shuffle mode.
- Fixed. The music lists screen was incorrectly attempting to display an alert sheet from a toolbar instead of a tab bar. This could only be observed when the queue screen (which displays a toolbar) was visited before visiting the music lists screen and attempting a long press on the music list screen. The alert sheet would not display properly
    and the app had to be exited and killed.
- Fixed. A bug that prevented new playlists from being displayed on the playlist screen.
- Immediately persist newly created playlists in case the app is terminated unexpectedly, data isn't lost.
- Fixed a crasher that sometimes occurred while visiting the playlist screen after creating a new playlist. The fix was to call reloadData instead of reloadRowsAtIndexes on the wire tableview.
- Partially Fixed OHM-30. All songs tables now respond to swipes to add to queue, and long presses to bring up the action sheet: Add to Queue. Add to Playlist is still outstanding.
- Fixed OHM-11. (Functional) Assets Updated (Now Playing).
- Fixed OHM-12 (by Jess). Playlist Artwork Picker (Lists).
- Fixed OHM-17. App Transitions (Universal). What you see (in the Mar 17 build) is what we decided was good enough for 1.0.
- Fixed OHM-64. There should be a search button on the home/now playing screen.

New Issues:

- The simulator's music player cannot return to sequential mode once placed in shuffle mode.
- The player controls do not yet display shuffle or repeat buttons.

Outstanding Known Issues:

- Add To Playlist is not represented at all.
- The A-Z scroller needs improvement.
- Search has not been implemented.
- If the user is editing a playlist and then selects another playlist, editing stops abruptly without animation. A better solution is for the playlists to scroll off the screen while editing... (Deferring to 1.1).
