The device IDs in DeviceIDs.txt were primarily derived from the Jan_12_Wave_1.mobileprovision provided by Chris Bennet in Jan 2012.

I added my own device as well.

The format is a tab separated format specified by Apple to allow bulk uploading of device IDs here (https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/devices/howto.action).

Note: the same device ID cannot be uploaded twice. The provisioning portal will report an error.

I added the following IDs on Feb 28:
